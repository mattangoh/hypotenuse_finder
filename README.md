# Simple Hypotenuse Calculator Project in Go

![Go CI: Github Actions](https://github.com/mattangoh/hypotenuse_finder/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

This is a mini go project to get used to learning how to structure Go projects... Therefore, I am implementing a small hypotenuse finder, giving it some test cases, and then using Github actions for my CI/CD.

## Building the App
To test out the app you need to build the file on your own system. 

On windows:
```bash
go build -o hypotenuse_calculator.exe .\cmd\myapp\myapp\main.go
```
Then you can run the executable.

## Usage

Input the length of the first and second side, and then it will return to you the hypotenuse. Pretty easy.
